# **Model Science Behind GLOHU: The Predictive Engine Fighting Global Hunger**

The GLOHU project is built on a structured and scientific modeling pipeline designed to forecast global food prices with high reliability. Below is the full breakdown of the **model science**, detailing the theory, reasoning, and analytical backbone behind your system.

---

## **1. Theoretical Framework**

The project is grounded in a combination of **economic theory**, **time-series forecasting**, and **machine learning prediction**.

### ✔ **Economic Theory**

Food prices are driven by:

* Supply shocks (weather, climate change, pests)
* Demand fluctuations (population growth, income changes)
* Global market signals (oil prices, exchange rates, trade policies)
* Seasonal patterns (harvest cycles)

These factors generate **non-linear**, **dynamic**, and sometimes **chaotic** behavior—making machine learning ideal for capturing hidden patterns.

---

## **2. Data Generating Process (DGP)**

GLOHU assumes that food price movements follow a mixture of:

### **(a) Trend Component**

Long-term upward or downward movement driven by:

* Inflation
* Technology improvements
* Structural changes in supply chains

### **(b) Seasonal Component**

Repeating patterns caused by:

* Harvest periods
* Rainfall cycles
* Festivals and holidays

### **(c) Cyclical Component**

Medium-term fluctuations based on:

* Global commodity cycles
* Policy changes
* Market sentiment

### **(d) Irregular Component**

Unexpected shocks:

* Wars
* Pandemics
* Natural disasters

This decomposition allows the model to isolate **signal from noise**.

## **3. Feature Engineering Science**

Your model transforms raw data into high-value numerical features.

### ✨ **Time-Based Features**

* Month, Year, Quarter
* Lag values (t−1, t−3, t−12)
* Rolling averages (3, 6, 12 months)
* Price volatility indicators

### ✨ **Economic Features**

* CPI
* Exchange rate
* Oil prices
* Interest rate
* Food production index

### ✨ **Climate Features**

* Rainfall index
* Temperature anomaly
* Drought severity

These features help the model understand both **local dynamics** and **global forces**.

## **4. Modeling Science**

GLOHU uses a **hybrid modeling framework** to maximize accuracy:

---

### **A. Classical Models**

These capture trend + seasonality very well:

#### **1. ARIMA / SARIMA**

Good for stable, low-variance data
Formula:
**Yₜ = c + ϕ₁Yₜ₋₁ + … + θ₁ϵₜ₋₁ + … + seasonal terms**

#### **2. Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing)**

Models level, trend, and seasonality.

These classical models create a **baseline forecast**.

---

### **B. Machine Learning Models**

These capture non-linear behavior.

#### **1. Random Forest Regressor**

Captures complex interactions between:

* climate
* economics
* market pressures

#### **2. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)**

Learns from errors sequentially
Strong on tabular data with mixed feature types.

#### **3. Linear Regression**

Used for interpretability
Shows which factors influence price the most.

---

### **C. Deep Learning Models**

Used for sequence prediction.

#### **1. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)**

Captures long-term dependencies in price history.

#### **2. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**

Lightweight and fast.
Useful when data is small or noisy.

These models form the **core predictive engine**.

---

## **5. Ensemble Science**

To increase robustness, GLOHU combines predictions using:

### ✔ **Weighted Averaging**

Higher weight = model with lower validation error.

### ✔ **Stacking**

Outputs of base models become input to a meta-model.

This produces a **balanced**, **stable**, and **high-accuracy** long-term forecast.

---

## **6. Evaluation Science**

### **Metrics Used**

* **RMSE** → measures average prediction error
* **MAE** → measures real-world error in currency terms
* **MAPE** → shows percentage error
* **R² Score** → how much variance the model explains

### **Why These?**

Because food prices are sensitive, the model must minimize both:

* absolute error
* proportional error

---

## **7. Error Analysis Science**

The project analyzes errors by studying:

### ✔ **Residual Plots**

Checks randomness of model errors.

### ✔ **Prediction Errors by Month**

To see if seasonality is miscaptured.

### ✔ **Feature Sensitivity**

Shows which variables distort predictions.

This helps improve the modeling pipeline.

---

## **8. Model Deployment Science**

The predictive engine is deployed through:

### ⭐ Streamlit Web App

* Real-time predictions
* Dynamic charts
* Interactive analysis

### ⭐ Scheduled Model Retraining

The model automatically adapts to:

* new climate patterns
* new global shocks
* new policy changes

This ensures predictions remain reliable.
